## Theme Options
### 1. Adaptation WITHIN Ordinary
The resilience and adaptation of programs, infrastructure, architectural forms in cities or communities during daily life or disaster, which include but not limited to self-sensing and self-changes of the  operating system, real-time temporary changes planned by the government, and the most common yet important one - changes spontaneously organised by the residents. 
Possible workshop: (for citizens) AVG game where the rigidity of a city is exaggerated; (for citizens)  SRPG game where a city with system for adaptation and resilience can by experienced / (for academia, professionals, government) to see what actually affect city or neighborhood resilience through simulations, thus defining indicators related to urban resilience / (CityScope) develop a urban resilience indicator.

城市/社区功能、基础设施、建筑形态在日常运行或灾害情况下的弹性——运行系统的自感知自改变，政府的实时临时性规划改变，以及最日常的、最重要的，居民主动发起的改变。形式：（居民）冒险游戏，放大现有城市系统中的“不可变“ / （居民）模拟人生，体验生活如何在一套具有适应性的城市系统中展开 / （学者/从业者/政府）通过模拟研究那些因素影响了社区弹性，以此定义与urban resilience相关的指标 / （CityScope）Urban Resilience Indicator。

### 2. Chances WITHIN Reach/Doorstep
This topic focuses on the improvement of CityScope: ① We can use small workshops to discuss what communities and individuals pay more attention to when talking about the city design and planning; ② Explore the versatility: cross-platform and cross-industry applications; ③ Explore whether more abstract content can be expressed (such as the scenario of Zhangjiang AIsland, in which more attention will be paid to the factors of the industry. In this case can the lego unit be related to the nature/scale of the industries and the companies?)

该主题关注cityscope的改进：① 可以通过小型workshop，探讨社区和个人在看待城市时更关注什么；②探究通用性：跨平台与跨行业的使用；③探究是否可以表达更加抽象的内容（比如张江人工智能岛的场景下，会更关注于产业的因素，能否把lego unit与产业和公司性质/规模关联起来）

### 3. Data WITHIN Users
People seem to have a higher tolerance for data being collected when they believe the usage of which is for safety and efficiency. However, is it because we are not yet the specific ‘victim’ of data being publicly exposed?  What if we can imagine an alternative against the digital dictatorship or ‘Social Dilemma’? 
Possible workshop: (for citizen) game to experience the data leakage issue;  (for citizen, academia, professionals, government) through tracking behaviors in the game of a neighbourhood with decentralised data donation & utilisation system, to understand the willingness of participation, what incentive policies are effective, what efforts and decisions need to be made, how sensors would be placed, where is the balance between decentralization and intervene, etc.; (software development) decentralised data donation & utilisation platform.

当人们相信数据被用于创建更安全、高效的环境时，似乎便会对其集中收集、分析拥有更高容忍度。然而，这是否仅仅因为我们没有成为那个隐私被公开的个体？是否可以想象一个对抗科技独裁的方式，让电影《监视资本主义：智能陷阱》不再是现实的映射？形式：（居民）游戏体验数据被泄露或公开 / （居民/学者/从业者/政府）模拟一个拥有去中心化数据平台系统的社区，通过追踪游戏行为，理解居民参与意愿、激励政策的有效性、运作模式、sensor布设及去中心化和干预之间的平衡在哪里/ （软件开发）数字化社区信用系统。

### 4. Decentralization WITHIN Resilience
Resilience simulation and decision-making in the face of crises is a very valuable topic, especially in the future, natural disasters around the world will occur more frequently (due to global warming). The possibility of decentralized decision-making and dynamic incentive mechanisms in the application of urban disaster resilience, the application of SoCity's ideas in disaster situations, include: what is the willingness to participate in digital community credit? How to adopt dynamic incentive policies (what are the possible effective incentive policies)? How to stimulate the pro-social behavior of individuals and the pro-social development of organizations, and establish a decentralized urban voting (residential communities earn geo-token for local city decision-making)?

面对危机的弹性化模拟和决策是个很有价值的topic，特别是未来全球各处的自然灾害会越来越多地发生（由于全球变暖)。去中心化决策与激励机制于城市应灾韧性运用的可能性，就是SoCity的想法在灾难状态下有什么运用。数字化社区信用的参与意愿如何？如何通过动态激励政策（有哪些可能有效的激励政策）？如何激励个人的亲社会行为和组织的亲社会发展,建立去中心化的城市投票（居住社区赚取geo-token，用于本地城市决策）？

### 5. Flexibility WITHIN Resilience
Explore the multi-functions of urban space, including normal functions (initial functions) and resilient functions (within the elastic range to ensure that the system will not collapse). Temporary public space, under certain means, enables the public space to help the development of local communities, and can play a role in the community beyond a mere venue for events. Given the space, number and resources of the community, how to deal with various simulated emergencies? Specifically, the workshop can be either a discussion of the use of some non-traditional community space, or an idea of the architectural form in the future city.

探索城市空间多用途的功能，包括通常功能（初始功能）和弹性状态功能（在弹性范围内保证了系统不会崩溃）。临时公共空间在一定手段下，使公共空间能够帮助在地社区发展，在社区中可以发挥超越一个单纯的活动场地的作用。当给定社区的空间、人数和资源，如何应对各类模拟突发情况？具体来说，该workshop既可以是对一些非传统的社区空间的利用方式的探讨，又可以是对未来城市中建筑形式的设想。

### 6. Individual WITHIN Crowd
‘Masterplan’ - firstly, without a community participation platform, Masterplan is mostly done by ‘masters’; secondly, principles for Masterplan are at a ‘master’ scale. ‘Big Data’ - too ‘big’ to avoid generalisation and simplification. Consequence - within neighbourhoods, unreasonable universal design and informal spontaneous alternations co-exist. 
Possible workshop: (for citizen) AVG game where the planned unreasonable universal design is exaggerated; (for citizens)  SRPG game where one needs to constantly make informal changes once they encounter unreasonable design, and the influence will be visualised; (for academia, professionals, government) through tracking how citizens play the game, to understand local preferences of urban design, especially for those different from conventional design principle or general big data analysis result; (software) platform for participation or platform for collection as a complement to big data analysis, maybe as an extension to CityScope.

‘Masterplan’ - 第一，公共参与机制不成熟，规划设计局限于’masters’; 第二，规划设计原则通常在’masters’尺度。‘大数据’ - 太”大“以至于难以避免一概而论和抽象简化。结果 - 在社区中，不合时宜的通用设计与居民自发的非正式调整共存。形式：（居民）冒险游戏，放大一些规划常见但在日常生活中不合理的场景 /（ 居民）不断参与城市设计，做出决策 or 一旦遇到规划不合理即可以做出informal changes，可视化其影响 /（学者/从业者/政府）平台，用于收集不同地区居民的偏好与疑惑，帮助“城市设计理论”做出因地制宜的调整，或是一些与大数据指标分析出来的结果不同的在地现象 / （软件开发）社区共建及共治平台 / 对大数据的补充（如果把大数据理解为representative formality，那么informal即是难以被一概而论的个体选择；可以作为CityScope的拓展？）

### 7. Normality WITHIN Resilience
Establish a gamification platform similar to Equity Without Zoning or CityScope+ABM(GAMA) to simulate the resilience of a city or community facing disasters, and define indicators related to urban resilience to study which factors affect and determine the resilience of the city/community for guidancing how to establish a new normal to maintain normal order in the face of special disasters. The meaning of the title is to establish a (new) normal state in which cities maintain resilience/resilience in response to disasters (currently, there is also a "normalization" in the prevention and control of Covid-19 pandemic in China). The workshop combines the professional simulation platform GAMA with the game platform Unity to achieve the combination of the advantages of the two tools, taking into account the rigor of scientific research and the popularity of the game, and can be realized through the front and back ends of GAMA and Unity.

建立类似Equity Without Zoning或者CityScope+Agent-based model (GAMA)的游戏化平台，来模拟城市或者社区对于灾害的弹性，并通过定义与urban resilience相关的指标，来研究哪些因素影响和决定了城市/社区的弹性，以此来指导在面临特殊灾害时该如何建立新的常态来维持正常秩序。标题含义即建立城市在应对灾害维持弹性/弹性范围内的（新）常态（目前国内对于疫情防控也有“常态化”一说）。该workshop把专业模拟平台GAMA与游戏结合，达到两个工具优势的结合，兼顾科学研究的严谨性和游戏的通俗性，并且可以通过GAMA与Unity的前后端互通来实现。

### 8. Resilience WITHIN Order
We cannot talk about resilience without talking about performance. What are China's advantages in the face of disasters? For other countries, what disasters have not been experienced? The concept of wartime communism proposed that in the face of strong oppression in reality, we should ① achieve strong cooperation and strong supervision;② maintain basic welfare and social operations in a crisis. Is it possible to build a platform to simulate the various performances of a city/neighborhood within a resilient range under different methods and degrees of regulation in the face of disasters?

谈弹性不能丧失性能。中国面对灾害时的优势何在？对于其他国家，哪些是没有经历的？战时共产主义概念提出，面对现实强压迫，应当①实现强合作与强监管②在危机中维持基本福利和社会运转。是否可以建立一个平台来模拟在面对灾害时不同方式和程度的调控下，城市在弹性范围内的各项性能？

### 9. Space WITHIN Epidemic
Social distance provides an anti-logical idea of interactions: interact within a certain distance. This workshop involves the use of indoor smart sensors and other state-of-art technologies. The advantage is that we already have the corresponding research, and it is easier to realize than what we did before.

social distance提供了一种反逻辑思路，即保持一定距离的交互。该方向涉及sensor的使用。优势在于我们已经有相应的技术，并且比LivingLine一期简单

### 10. Parking WITHIN Reach
Bike parking tides have become an interesting scene in China as bike sharing extends its coverage. The battle of searching for one slot to squeeze your bike or finding one bike that can be ridden happens everyday. The topic is to work on a system tackling this issue.
Possible workshop: (for citizen) surviving or strategy game for the above-mentioned battle; (for academia, professionals, government) through simulation of a city with massive smart lightweight transportation, to understand its operation, location-selection, pros and cons; (software & hardware) add-ons and infrastructure for sharing bike / other lightweight mobility mode design, etc.

共享单车的潮汐现象 - 时而堆积成山，时而一辆也抢不到。形式：（居民）停车位或单车抢夺战  /（学者/从业者/政府）模拟一个拥有大规模投放的智慧化轻量交通系统的城市，它该如何选址，它的benefits＆costs是什么（一般认为它必然是好的？） / （软件开发）适用于共享单车的add-on如 sensor；其他交通工具设计；交通系统设计及模拟
